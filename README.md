<h1>OFFSET</h1>
OFFSET is a react native application aimed at helping you track and offset your plastic bottle consumption. 
<br><br>
The UI features buttons to log when you've used a plastic and/or reusable bottle and calculates your offset count. The goal is to have a negative offset number.

<h2>Before running locally</h2>
This mobile application is not yet available in any app store. To preview the app, you'll need to download the expo client, available here:
<br>
	<b>Android</b>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www">Android App</a>
	<br>
	<b>iOS</b>: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779">iOS App</a>
<br>

<h2>Run locally</h2>
1) In terminal run `npm start` 
<br>
2) In terminal logs, a QR code will appear. Scan the QR code with the Expo app (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)
<br>

<h2>What's ahead</h2>
This is a WIP and there are many features I'd like to add in the future including:<br>
- Metrics on offset count over time <br>
- Predictive analysis to help a user beat what they are forcasted to use<br>
- Ability to track other types of plastic<br>
- Interesting facts around plastic consumption<br>
- Web UI<br>
- Launch on an app store near you!
